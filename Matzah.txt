Matzah

2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1.5 teaspoon salt
1.5 teaspoon rosemary
1.5 teaspoon thyme
water ~ varies (just enough to form a dough)

Directions:

Mix dry ingredients together, then add the olive oil and mix until 
the olive oil forms tiny balls.

Add enough water to form dough, then knead on counter-top for 5 minutes or
until dough is really tough.

Then wrap it in plastice wrap for 5 minutes to let the gluten rest.

While the dough is resting, heat a skillet on the stove-top.

Cut 2 tapespoons worth of dough off and roll out of a lightly floured
counter to the desired size. Then place in an oiled-skillet and cook until
lightly brown. Enjoy!
